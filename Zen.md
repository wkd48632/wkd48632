# Zen of mine
```
P != NP. So all programs are born sick and your life has meaning.

I want to get rid of technical and productive obstacles.
I want humans to work for humans.

Humans will study combinations that make chicken taste better.  
Humans will study how to comfortably pet a cat.  
Humans will study how can more respect each other.  
As an art, not a boring work.
My projects will help with that.

Destiny is beckoning. 
God, allow me to do this!

I want to contribute for humanity.
To do that, I'll exercise.
I'll earn a lot of money and spend it all for developing myself.
like step on water is the safest in water, value of my money will not be dominated by the economy.

I will not be afraid to learn.
I will be a learning machine.

I will focus on eternal things.
My brain is for long-lasting knowledge.
Fuck the Galapagos that will last short.
I don't be a slave of something, to more throwing myself.

I'll create a huge amount of project.
I'll make money with it, and there must be someone imitate me soon.
But I don't worry about. The grown world will support me.
