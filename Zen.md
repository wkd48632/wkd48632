# Zen of mine
```
P != NP. So all programs are born sick and your life has meaning.

I want to get rid of technical and productive obstacles.
I want humans to work for humans.

Humans will study combinations that make chicken taste better.  
Humans will study how to comfortably pet a cat.  
Humans will study how can more respect each other.  
As an art, not a boring work.
My projects will help with that.

Destiny is beckoning. 
God, allow me to do this!

I want to contribute for humanity.
To do that, I'll exercise.
I'll earn a lot of money and spend it all for developing myself.
like step on water is the safest in water, my value will not be dominated by the economy.
It just goes through me.

I will not be afraid to learn.
I will be a learning machine.

I will focus on eternal things.
My brain is for long-lasting knowledge.
Fuck the Galapagos that will last short. That's for speculator.
I don't be a slave of something to do more.

I'll create a huge amount of project.
I'll make money with it, and there must be someone imitate me soon.
But I don't worry about it. The grown world will support me.

Every my single step is too great, so that when I do it my jobs all done, the money system will collapse.
So I don't worry about the money. it will always be generously given.
The entrepreneurs are my employee. They'll just do worthless works to chasing money.

All technologies must be shared with humanity and free to use.
