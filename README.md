### Zen
```
P != NP. So all programs are born sick and your life has meaning.

I want to get rid of technical and productive obstacles.
I want humans to work for humans.

Humans will study combinations that make chicken taste better.  
Humans will study how to comfortably pet a cat.  
Humans will study how can more respect each other.  
As an art, not a boring work.
My projects will help with that.

Destiny is beckoning. 
God, allow me to do this!
```
